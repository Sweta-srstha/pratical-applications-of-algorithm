    "Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.\n",

    "\n",
    "MinStack() initializes the stack object.\n",
    "void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.\n",
    "void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.\n",
    "int top() gets the top element of the stack.\n",
    "int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.\n",
    "You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input\n",

    "Output\n",

    "Attributes:\n",
    "    stack: This is a regular stack to store the values that are pushed.\n",
    "    minStack: This is used to store the minimum value at each point of time. It keeps track of the smallest element present in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "1. __init__():\n",
    "    This is the constructor method which initializes two empty stacks:\n",
    "    self.stack: This is the main stack where we store the values.\n",
    "    self.minStack: This auxiliary stack keeps track of the minimum value at every point.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. push(val: int) -> None:\n",
    "    When a new value val is pushed to stack, the idea is to maintain the minStack in such a way that the top of minStack always holds the current minimum.\n",
    "    You push the val into the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For minStack:\n",
    "    You compare val with the current top of minStack (i.e., self.minStack[-1]).\n",
    "    If minStack is empty, just push val into it (since it's the minimum when no other elements are present).\n",
    "    If minStack is not empty, you push the smaller of val and the current minimum (self.minStack[-1]).\n",
    "    This ensures that minStack always holds the minimum element at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. pop() -> None:\n",
    "    This method removes the top element from both stack and minStack simultaneously.\n",
    "    Since minStack stores the minimum corresponding to every element in stack, removing the top element from stack means you also need to remove the corresponding minimum from minStack.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. top() -> int:\n",
    "    This method simply returns the top element of stack, which is the last element pushed into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. getMin() -> int:\n",
    "    This method returns the top element of minStack, which is the current minimum element in the stack."
